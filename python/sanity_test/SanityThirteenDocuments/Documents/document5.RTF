\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs17  Five, who had been anxiously\par
looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'\par
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon\par
their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice\par
looked round, eager to see the Queen.\par
\par
  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped\par
like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and\par
feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\par
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\par
soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were\par
ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\par
in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next\par
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\par
recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\par
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\par
noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\par
King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\par
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\par
\par
  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\par
her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember\par
every having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,\par
what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people\par
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see\par
it?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.\par
\par
  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped\par
and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'\par
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in\par
reply.\par
\par
  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,\par
turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'\par
\par
  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very\par
politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of\par
cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'\par
\par
  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three\par
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as\par
they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs\par
was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\par
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her\par
own children.\par
\par
  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\par
`It's no business of MINE.'\par
\par
  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her\par
for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!\par
Off--'\par
\par
  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the\par
Queen was silent.\par
\par
  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said\par
`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'\par
\par
  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave\par
`Turn them over!'\par
\par
  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\par
\par
  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the\par
three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the\par
King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\par
\par
  `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'\par
And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you\par
been doing here?'\par
\par
  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,\par
going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'\par
\par
  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the\par
roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,\par
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate\par
gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\par
\par
  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a\par
large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered\par
about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly\par
marched off after the others.\par
\par
  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\par
\par
  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers\par
shouted in reply.\par
\par
  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'\par
\par
  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question\par
was evidently meant for her.\par
\par
  `Yes!' shouted Alice.\par
\par
  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the\par
procession, wondering very much what would happen next.\par
\par
  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.\par
She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously\par
into her face.\par
\par
  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'\par
\par
  `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He\par
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised\par
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and\par
whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'\par
\par
  `What for?' said Alice.\par
\par
  `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.\par
\par
  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.\par
I said "What for?"'\par
\par
  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a\par
little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a\par
frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came\par
rather late, and the Queen said--'\par
\par
  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,\par
and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up\par
against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or\par
two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a\par
curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and\par
furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live\par
flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\par
stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\par
\par
  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her\par
flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,\par
comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,\par
but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened\par
out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it\par
WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a\par
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\par
and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\par
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\par
itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,\par
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\par
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers\par
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\par
ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very\par
difficult game indeed.\par
\par
  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,\par
quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in\par
a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went\par
stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with\par
her head!' about once in a minute.\par
\par
  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as\par
yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might\par
happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of\par
me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great\par
wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'\par
\par
  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering\par
whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a\par
curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at\par
first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to\par
be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I\par
shall have somebody to talk to.'\par
\par
  `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was\par
mouth enough for it to speak with.\par
\par
  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no\par
use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at\par
least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,\par
and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the\par
game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The\par
Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and\par
no more of it appeared.\par
\par
  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather\par
a complaining tone,' and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't\par
hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in\par
particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and\par
you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;\par
for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next\par
walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have\par
croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it\par
saw mine coming?'\par
\par
  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\par
\par
  `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then\par
she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so\par
she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while\par
finishing the game.'\par
\par
  The Queen smiled and passed on.\par
\par
  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and\par
looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\par
\par
  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me\par
to introduce it.'\par
\par
  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,\par
it may kiss my hand if it likes.'\par
\par
  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\par
\par
  `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me\par
like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.\par
\par
  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in\par
some book, but I don't remember where.'\par
\par
  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and\par
he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I\par
wish you would have this cat removed!'\par
\par
  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great\par
or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking\par
round.\par
\par
  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and\par
he hurried off.\par
\par
  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game\par
was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,\par
screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three\par
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and\par
she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in\par
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or\par
not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.\par
\par
  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,\par
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one\par
of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her\par
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where\par
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up\par
into a tree.\par
\par
  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,\par
the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:\par
`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches\par
are gone from the side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away\par
under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for\par
a little more conversation with her friend.\par
\par
  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to\par
find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute\par
going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who\par
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,\par
and looked very uncomfortable.\par
\par
  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to\par
settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,\par
though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed\par
to make out exactly what they said.\par
\par
  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a\par
head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had\par
never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin\par
at HIS time of life.\par
\par
CHAPTER VIII  The Queen's Croquet-Ground\par
\par
\par
\par
  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the\par
roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at\par
it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious\par
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up\par
to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go\par
splashing paint over me like that!'\par
\par
  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged\par
my elbow.'\par
\par
  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always\par
lay the blame on others!'\par
\par
  `YOU'D better not talk!'said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only\par
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'\par
\par
  `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.\par
\par
  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.\par
\par
  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it\par
was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'\par
\par
  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all\par
the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as\par
she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the\par
others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\par
\par
  `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are\par
painting those roses?'\par
\par
  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a\par
low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to\par
have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;\par
and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads\par
cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore\par
she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously\par
looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'\par
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon\par
their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice\par
looked round, eager to see the Queen.\par
\par
  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped\par
like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and\par
feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\par
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\par
soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were\par
ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\par
in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next\par
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\par
recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\par
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\par
noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\par
King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\par
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\par
\par
  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\par
her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember\par
every having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,\par
what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people\par
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see\par

\par
  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped\par
and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'\par
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in\par
reply.\par
\par
  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,\par
turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'\par
\par
  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very\par
politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of\par
cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'\par
\par
  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three\par
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as\par
they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs\par
was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\par
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her\par

\par
  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\par
`It's no business of MINE.'\par
\par
  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her\par
for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!\par
Off--'\par
\par
  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the\par
Queen was silent.\par
\par
  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said\par
`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'\par
\par
  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave\par
`Turn them over!'\par
\par
  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\par
\par
  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the\par
three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the\par
King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\par
\par
  `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'\par
And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you\par
been doing here?'\par
\par
  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,\par
going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'\par

large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered\par

marched off after the others.\par
\par
  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\par
\par
  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers\par
shouted in reply.\par
\par
  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'\par
\par
  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question\par
was evidently meant for her.\par
\par
  `Yes!' shouted Alice.\par
\par
  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the\par
procession, wondering very much what would happen next.\par
\par
  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.\par
She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously\par
into her face.\par
\par
  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'\par
\par
  `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He\par
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised\par
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and\par
whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'\par
\par
  `What for?' said Alice.\par
\par
  `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.\par
\par
  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.\par
I said "What for?"'\par
\par
  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a\par
little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a\par

\par
  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and\par
he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I\par

\par
  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great\par

round.\par
\par
  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and\par
he hurried off.\par
\par
  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game\par
was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,\par
screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three\par
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and\par
she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in\par
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or\par

\par
  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,\par
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one\par
of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her\par
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where\par
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up\par
into a tree.\par
\par
  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,\par
the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:\par
`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches\par
are gone from the side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away\par
under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for\par
a little more conversation with her friend.\par
\par
  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to\par
find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute\par
going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who\par
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,\par
and looked very uncomfortable.\par
\par
  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to\par
settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,\par
though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed\par
to make out exactly what they said.\par
\par
  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a\par
head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had\par
never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin\par
at HIS time of life.\par
\par
  The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\par
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\par
\par
  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about\par
it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.\par
(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so\par
grave and anxious.)\par
\par
  Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the\par
Duchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.'\par
\par
  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fetch\par
her here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.\par
\par
  The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\par
by the time he had disappeared; so the King and the executioner\par
ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the\par
party went back to the game.\par

CHAPTER IX    The Mock Turtle's Story\par
\par
\par
\par
  `You can't think you glad I am to see you again, you dear old\par
thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately\par
into Alice's, and they walked off together.\par
\par
  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and\par
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had\par
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.\par
\par
  `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very\par
hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT\par
ALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that\par
makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at\par
having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them\par
sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar\par
and such things that make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish\par
people knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you\par
know--'\par
\par
  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a\par
little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.\par
`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you\par
forget to talk.  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that\par
is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'\par
\par
  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.\par
\par
  `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a\par
moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up\par
closer to Alice's side as she spoke.\par
\par
  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,\par
because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was\par
exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,\par
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not\par
like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\par
\par
  `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of\par
keeping up the conversation a little.\par
\par
  `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"Oh,\par
'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'\par
\par
  `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody\par
minding their own business!'\par
\par
  `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,\par
digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,\par
`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the\par
sounds will take care of themselves."'\par
\par
  `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to\par
herself.\par
\par
  `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your\par
waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm\par
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the\par
experiment?'\par
\par
  `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all\par
anxious to have the experiment tried.\par
\par
  `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both\par
bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock\par
together."'\par
\par
  `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\par
\par
  `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess:  `what a clear way you\par
have of putting things!'\par
\par
  `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\par
\par
  `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree\par
to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near\par
here.  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the\par
less there is of yours."'\par
\par
  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this\par
last remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look like one, but it\par
is.'\par
\par
  `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of\par
that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put\par
more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than\par
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have\par
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared\par
to them to be otherwise."'\par
\par
  `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very\par
politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it\par
as you say it.'\par
\par
  `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess\par
replied, in a pleased tone.\par
\par
  `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'\par
said Alice.\par
\par
  `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.  `I make you\par
a present of everything I've said as yet.'\par
\par
  `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad they don't\par
give birthday presents like that!'  But she did not venture to\par
say it out loud.\par
\par
  `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her\par
sharp little chin.\par
\par
  `I've a right to think' said Alice sharply, for she was\par
beginning to feel a little worried.\par
\par
  `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to\par
fly; and the m--'\par
\par
  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died\par
away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the\par
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,\par
and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,\par
frowning like a thunderstorm.\par
\par
  `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak\par
voice.\par
\par
  `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on\par
the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,\par
and that in about half no time!  Take your choice!'\par
\par
  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\par
\par
  `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice\par
was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her\par
back to the croquet-ground.\par
\par
  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,\par
and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,\par
they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a\par
moment's delay would cost them their lives.\par
\par
  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off\par
quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his\par
head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were\par
taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave\par
off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour\par
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the\par
King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of\par
execution.\par
\par
  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to\par
Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\par
\par
  `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\par
\par
  `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\par
\par
  `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\par
\par
  `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his\par
history,'\par
\par
  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low\par
voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,\par
THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite\par
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\par
\par
  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the\par
sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)\par
`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to\par
see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and\par
see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,\par
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like\par
the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would\par
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage\par
Queen:  so she waited.\par
\par
  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the\par
Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'\par
said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\par
\par
  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.\par
\par
  `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they\par
never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'\par
\par
  `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went\par
slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,\par
never!'\par
\par
  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\par
distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\par
as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart\par
would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she\par
asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the\par
same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got\par
no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'\par
\par
  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with\par
large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\par
\par
  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to\par
know your history, she do.'\par
\par
  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow\par
tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've\par
finished.'\par
\par
  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice\par
thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he\par
doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.\par
\par
  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was\par
a real Turtle.'\par
\par
  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only\par
by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and\par
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very\par
nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your\par
interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be\par
more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\par
\par
  `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more\par
calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to\par
school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call\par
him Tortoise--'\par
